# PRODIGY_CS_03
This repository is part of my internship tasks at ProdigyInfotech, It is a password strength validator/checker that I created using Java programming language.
The program accepts passwords from the user and compares the password with the specified requirements of a strong password which would determine if the password is either weak or strong.

This program is open for improvement.
